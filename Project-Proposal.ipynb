    "As science and technology have been advanced swiftly, app markets are full of opportunities as well as challenges. While many public datasets provide Apple App Store data, there are not many counterpart datasets and visualization available for Google Play Store apps anywhere on the web. For the app-making business, we aim to provide the developers with some actionable insights in the Android market through the visualization of Google Play Store apps data."

    "With over 2.7 billion smartphone users across the world, it’s no surprise that the mobile app industry is thriving. App usage and smartphone penetration are still growing at a steady rate, without any signs of slowing down in the foreseeable future. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to some [statistics](https://buildfire.com/app-statistics/), the Apple App Store has 2.2 million apps available for download while there are 2.8 million apps on the Google Play Store. Besides, the developers need to pay Apple \\\\$99/year to keep your app online, but only [$25 one time for Google Play Store](https://yalantis.com/blog/apple-app-store-and-google-play-store/). Given the more strict and slower apps released process in the Apple Store, many developers are more satisfied with the policies of Android apps. Therefore, a thorough analysis of the Google Play Store data is very important for the developers who want to put more effort into the Android market. In the long run, it may create enormous values for both the public and private sectors to keep up with the era of mobile internet.  \n"

Then a question occurs to us: what if the developers want to switch from IOS to Android and they need to know about the app developing situation in the Android market? While the Android market is as important as the IOS market in many countries, there is not so much public dataset and analysis for it. Before we walk further into this problem, we want to question, wrangle, and explore the datasets we found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) using the visualizing and storytelling skills we discussed in class.

    "\n",
    "The data is scraped from the Google Play Store and is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps). The portfolio contains **two datasets** and we plan to analyze both of them for developing a comprehensive data exploration. Therefore, the data we use is spread across two tables and we'll join them together in further analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of **13 columns** and **10,842 rows**. Each row refers to a single Android app, and each column refers to one app characteristics, such as App category, overall ratings, size, price. All the columns are in object types except for the `Rating` columns, which is float type. With initial data exploration, we find:\n",
    "- The `Installs` column can be one of the dependable variables that can be categorized into 22 bins by numbers of installs. \n",
    "- The `Rating` column is missing 1,474 variables, the mean value is 4.19 and the standard deviation is 0.54.\n",
    "- The `Type` column is missing 1 variable and has 3 unique values.\n",
    "- The `Content Rating` is missing 1 variable and has 6 unique values.\n",
    "- The `Current Ver` column is missing 8 variables and has 10,833 unique values.\n",

Therefore, we need to clean data first.\n",

    "- For Question 3, we plan to visualize how ratings and download counts vary by app sizes for different categories. We expect to find a reasonable range of app size from the visualization.\n",
    "- For Question 4, we’ll focus on the reviews dataset. Using sentiment polarity data, we can analyze review sentiment differences between categories.Through generating word clouds for positive reviews and negative reviews, we could find the most common words, and especially, we could notice important factors that lead users to like or dislike an app. "
